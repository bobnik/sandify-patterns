# Thank you

Please add in some patterns here. They can be gcode, thr, or svg (although that isn't super helpful,
since we don't have a way to import svgs yet).

## Adding a pattern

Make a pull request. This is the only way I can do it now, since I don't have the ability to do a
big website that can manage submissions and things like that. Maybe someday.

## Adding documentation

A picture of the pattern, even if it's just a screenshot from sandify, will be really welcome. If
you don't know the markdown syntax for adding images, that's ok. Just add an image, and I will add
it to the markdown.

Adding a title, at least, is also welcome.

## Attribution

If you'd like attribution, add that to the description.

## Licenses

This repo is marked as MIT. If you submit a pattern, it will fall under the MIT license. Please
don't submit patterns with copyrighted shapes on them. I don't want to argue about it.
